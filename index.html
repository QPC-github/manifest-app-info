        This specification defines supplementary members of the Web App
        Manifest that provide additional metadata related to how the web
        application may be presented in the context of a digital storefront,
        installation dialog, or other surfaces where this web application may
        be marketed or distributed.

      <h2>
        Marketable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        As web applications become available via more services (e.g., digital
        storefronts, search results) where they are presented alongside native
        applications, it becomes quite important for them to appear similarly
        to their native counterparts. A web application can define both its
        {{WebAppManifest/name}} and {{WebAppManifest/icons}} in the manifest,
        but those keys do not provide enough information to help users
        determine whether they might want to install it. Users have become
        accustomed to being offered more details about the applications they
        consider installing, and this document defines additional manifest
        members that can provide that.

        The following steps for <dfn>processing application info in a

        <h3>
          <code title="">categories</code> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>categories</dfn> member describes the expected application
          categories to which the web application belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>categories</a> member is only meant as a hint to catalogs or
          stores listing web applications and it is expected that these will
          make a best effort to find appropriate categories (or category) under
          which to list the web application. Like search engines and meta
          keywords, catalogs and stores are not required to honor this hint.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steps for <dfn>processing the <code>categories</code>
          member</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm
          takes a sequence&lt;<a>DOMString</a>&gt; <var>categories</var> as an
          argument. This algorithm returns an
          <code>Array&lt;DOMString&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>[=list/For each=] <var>category</var> of <var>categories</var>:
            <ol>
              <li>[=set/Replace=] <var>category</var> within
              <var>categories</var> with <var>category</var>, <a>ascii
              lowercased</a>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Return <var>categories</var>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The categories <a>string</a> array is case insensitive and converted
          to lower-case by following the processing algorithm. Thus,
          <code>sports</code>, <code>Sports</code>, <code>SPORTS</code>, and
          <code>SpOrTs</code> are all equivalent.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Manifest authors are encouraged to use lower-case.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          This specification does not define the particular values for
          <dfn>DOMString</dfn>s for the <a>categories</a> member. However, the
          working group maintains a <a href=
          "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/wiki/Categories">list of known
          values</a> in our wiki.

        <h3>
          <code title="">description</code> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>description</dfn> member allows the developer to describe
          the purpose of the web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The {{WebAppManifestAppInfo/description}} member serves as the
          <a data-cite="accname-1.2#dfn-accessible-description">accessible
          description</a> of an [=installed web application=].

        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>iarc_rating_id</dfn> member is a <a>string</a> that
          represents the <a href="https://www.globalratings.com/">International
          Age Rating Coalition (IARC)</a> certification code of the web
          application. It is intended to be used to determine which ages the
          web application is appropriate for.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          An IARC certificate can be obtained via participating storefronts,
          intended to be used for distributing the web app. The
          <a>iarc_rating_id</a> member only takes a single certification code.
          The same code can be shared across participating storefronts, as long
          as the distributed product remains the same (i.e., doesnâ€™t serve
          totally different code paths depending on user agent sniffing and the
          like) and the other storefronts support it.

        <h3>
          <code title="">screenshots</code> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>screenshots</dfn> member is an <a>array</a> of
          {{ScreenshotImageResource}}s, representing the web application in
          common usage scenarios.
        </p>

      </pre>
      <p>
        Each {{ScreenshotImageResource}} is an image that provides examples of
        what the application looks like in various contexts. The
        {{ScreenshotImageResource}} leverages the infrastructure of the
        {{ManifestImageResource}}, with minor modifications.

        <h3>
          <dfn>label</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          For accessibility purposes, authors MUST provide a
          {{ImageResource/label}} for each screenshot. The
          {{ScreenshotImageResource/label}} member serves as the <a data-cite=
          "accname-1.2#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a> of that
          {{ScreenshotImageResource}}.

        <h3>
          <dfn>platform</dfn> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The {{ScreenshotImageResource/platform}} member represents the
          <a>platform</a> for which a given screenshot applies. Authors are
          encouraged to only use this member when the screenshot is only
          applicable in a specific context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different digital storefronts and services may want to define their
          own string values for this property. To allow the community to easily
          track those values, weâ€™ve created a <a href=
          "https://github.com/w3c/manifest-app-info/wiki/Platform-Registry">Platform
          Registry</a>.
