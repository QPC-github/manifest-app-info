        This document is a registry of supplementary members for the
        [[[appmanifest]]] specification that provide additional metadata for
        use in a digital storefront or other surfaces where this web
        application may be marketed or distributed (i.e., outside the context
        of a web browser).

        This is document is constantly evolving and we publish new snapshots
        every time we commit a change. Interested parties can subscribe to
        changes or even propose new manifest members in the <a href=

      <h2>
        Marketable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        As web applications become available via more services (e.g., digital
        storefronts, search results) where they are presented alongside native
        applications, it becomes quite important for them to appear similarly
        to their native counterparts. A web application can define both its
        {{WebAppManifest/name}} and {{WebAppManifest/icons}} in the manifest,
        but those keys do not provide enough information to help users
        determine whether they might want to install it. Users have become
        accustomed to being offered more details about the applications they
        consider installing, and this document defines additional manifest
        members that can provide that.

      <h2>
        Supplementary manifest members
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following members supplement the members of an [=application
        manifest=]. All members are all optional and can be added at the root
        of an [=application manifest=], as shown in the following example.
      </p>
      <pre class="example json" title="Using the supplementary members">
      {
        "name": "Donate App",
        "categories": ["fundraising", "donations"],
        "description": "This app helps you donate to worthy causes.",
        "iarc_rating_id": "e84b072d-71b3-4d3e-86ae-31a8ce4e53b7",

        }]
      }
      </pre>
      <p>
        As the [=application manifest=] is JSON, this the members of this
        specification are of the types <dfn>object</dfn>, <dfn>array</dfn>, and
        <dfn>string</dfn> as defined in [[[ECMA-404]]].

          `categories` member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>categories</dfn></code> member is an <a>array</a> of
          <a>strings</a> that describes the application categories to which the
          web application belongs. It is meant as a hint to catalogs or stores
          listing web applications and it is expected that these will make a
          best effort to find appropriate categories (or category) under which
          to list the web application. Like search engines and meta keywords,
          catalogs and stores are not required to honor this hint.
        </p>

        <h3>
          `description` member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>description</dfn></code> member is a <a>string</a>
          that allows the developer to describe the purpose of the web
          application. It serves as the <a data-cite=
          "accname-1.2#dfn-accessible-description">accessible description</a>
          of an [=installed web application=].

        <h3>
          `iarc_rating_id` member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>iarc_rating_id</dfn></code> member is a <a>string</a>
          that represents the <a href=
          "https://www.globalratings.com/">International Age Rating Coalition
          (IARC)</a> certification code of the web application. It is intended
          to be used to determine which ages the web application is appropriate
          for.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          An IARC certificate can be obtained via participating storefronts,
          intended to be used for distributing the web app. The
          <a>iarc_rating_id</a> member only takes a single certification code.
          The same code can be shared across participating storefronts, as long
          as the distributed product remains the same (i.e., doesn’t serve
          totally different code paths depending on user agent sniffing and the
          like) and the other storefronts support it.
        </p>
        <p>

          The <code><dfn>screenshots</dfn></code> member is an array of
          <a>screenshots objects</a>, representing the web application in
          common usage scenarios.

          The <code><dfn>label</dfn></code> member is a <a>string</a> that

          "accname-1.2#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a> of that
          <a>screenshots object</a>. For accessibility, authors are encouraged

        <h3>
          `platform` member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>platform</dfn></code> member is a <a>string</a> that
          represents the operating system for which a given screenshot applies.
          Authors are encouraged to only use this member when the screenshot is
          only applicable in a specific context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different digital storefronts and services may want to define their
          own string values for this property. To allow the community to easily
          track those values, we’ve created a <a href=
          "https://github.com/w3c/manifest-app-info/wiki/Platform-Registry">Platform
          Registry</a>.
